								<p>
									Making things from scratch can be a whole lot more fun than just, you know, buying them. Especially when we collab with other fun people!
								</p>
								<p>If you had three days to disconnect from the routine and try something new, what would you be interested in making? What can you help others learn how to make?</p>

							<h2>Explore the ethical issues around making</h2>
							<p>
								While making things is fun, it's just as important to understand the historical context and the unintended consequences of pushing things out into the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								We don't make in isolation. Whatever we make affects people and the environment in a myriad ways; the social and power dynamics between people; our personal identities, privacy, agency and freedom.
							</p>
							<p>With this mind, what topics would you like to explore? Anything you'd like to present a session on?</p>
