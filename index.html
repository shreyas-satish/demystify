							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-hand-peace-o">
									<h3>Respect personal space</h3>
									<p>Demystify is meant to be a safe and inclusive space. Always ask before engaging with someone's personal space. Respect their decision. Demystify will have awareness and child-care teams on site.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-leaf">
									<h3>Care for the environment</h3>
									<p>Do not bring any plastic that will be disposed on site. Leave the place better than it was.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-exchange">
									<h3>Engage</h3>
									<p>Demystify is a highly participative event. Propose a session, make something, engage in discussions and help put an amazing event together. Passive participation is highly discouraged.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-home">
									<h3>Make it your own</h3>
									<p>Demystify is what we make of it. We live together for the weekend. Look out for each other, treat it like home.</p>
