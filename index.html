									<h3>Engage</h3>
									<p>Demystify is a highly participative event. Make something, propose to present, engage in discussions or volunteer and help put an amazing event together. Passive participation is highly discouraged.</p>

								<li class="icon fa-home">
									<h3>Make it our own</h3>
