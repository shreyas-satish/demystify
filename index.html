							<h2>What is Demystify?</h2>
							<p>
								Technology can sometimes be intimidating. It's common to treat computers, networks or vehicles as black boxes, turn knobs and hope for the best. It doesn't have to be that way.
							</p>
							<p>
								demystify is an effort to make learning how technology works more accessible. And as a term, its definition isn't really limited to the current wave of digital technologies.
							</p>
							</p>
							<p>
								demystify is taking shape as a camping festival near Bangalore and is a highly participative event.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a participant, you'll pick something you're interested in ‚Äî radios, wood working or beer brewing ‚Äî learn how it's put together from peers, and then make it yourself. It's hands-on learning and experimentation at its best.
							</p>

							<p>
								While making things is fun, it's just as important to understand the historical context and the unintended consequences of pushing things out into the world.

								We don't make in isolation. Whatever we make affects people and the environment in a myriad ways; the social and power dynamics between people; our personal identities, privacy, agency and freedom.
