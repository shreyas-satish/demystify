								<h2>Making. Demystified.</h2>
								<p>Urban lifestyles can tend us towards taking things <i>as is</i>. Ever wonder about how things are grown, made and distributed?</p>
								<p>Pick something you're interested in learning more about, and make it with fellow campers. Learn how to grow vegetables, bake bread or brew your own beer. Make your own furniture. The sky is the limit. Make something new.</p>

								<p>We don't make in isolation. Whatever we make affects people in a myriad ways; the social and power dynamics between people; our personal privacy, agency and freedom. For instance, in what ways could a national identification project affect a billion lives?</p>

									<h3>Engage</h3>
									<p>Demystify is a highly participative event. Make something, present a session, engage in discussions or volunteer and help put an amazing event together. Passive participation is highly discouraged.</p>

									<h3>Make it our own</h3>
