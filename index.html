							<h2>What is Demystify?</h2>
							<p>
								demystify is an effort to understand how and why things are made, and exploring more sustainable alternatives to popular things on the market.
							</p>
							<p>
								Being able to understand <i>how</i> things work and making our own versions is empowering. It lets us shape things so that they work in ways we want them to. And repair them when they break down.
							</p>
							<p>
								Exploring <i>why</i> things are made is important too! Things aren't made in a vacuum. Hence, understanding historical context and anticipating unintended consequences goes a long way.
							</p>
							<p>
								demystify is taking shape as a camping festival near Bangalore and is a highly participative event. The agenda is largely informed by what the participants want to explore.
							</p>
							<!-- <p>*well not completely from scratch, because you know, that might <a href="https://recursive.recipes/recipe/chocolate-chip-cookies?amount=36&timelimit=45517160&ingredientsToBuild=" target="_blank">take a while.</a></p> -->

								<p>
									Making things from scratch can be a whole lot more fun than just, you know, buying them. Especially when we collaborate with other fun people!
								</p>
								<p>
									Take a workshop on weaving hats and lamp shades from the local crafts center, learn how to work with wood and bamboo or understand how you can setup a network in the country side. Make something new.
								</p>
								<p>
									What would you be interested in making? What can you help others learn how to make?

							<h2>Explore the ethical issues around making</h2>
							<p>
								While making things is fun, it's just as important to understand the historical context and the unintended consequences of pushing things out into the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								We don't make in isolation. Whatever we make affects people and the environment in a myriad ways; the social and power dynamics between people; our personal identities, privacy, agency and freedom.
