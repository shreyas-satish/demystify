							<h2>What is Demystify?</h2>
							<p>
								Technology can sometimes be intimidating. It's common to treat computers, networks or vehicles as black boxes, turn knobs and hope for the best. It doesn't have to be that way.
							</p>
							<p>
								demystify is an effort to make learning how technology works more accessible. And as a term, its definition isn't really limited to the current wave of digital technologies.
							</p>
							</p>
							<p>
								As a participant, you'll pick something you're interested in — radios, wood working or beer brewing — learn how it's put together from peers, and then make it yourself. It's hands-on learning and experimentation at its best.
							</p>
							<p>
								demystify is taking shape as a camping festival near Bangalore and is a highly participative event.

							<h2>Explore the ethical issues around making</h2>
							<p>
								While making things is fun, it's just as important to understand the historical context and the unintended consequences of pushing things out into the world.

							<p>
								We don't make in isolation. Whatever we make affects people and the environment in a myriad ways; the social and power dynamics between people; our personal identities, privacy, agency and freedom.
